# Bag-of-Students-3

This is just an assignment I did for Data Structures. I sorted my own ADT, called a Student, within a custom collection class Bag that was given by the instructor. I put it up, because of how I implemented quicksort inside the Bag's sort_descending() function using two lambda expressions. It was an eye-opening experience for me and it was very satisfying to accomplish.
